He is depicted as someone who dislikes anything unusual, such as people dressed in funny clothes or the sight of owls during the day. He is married to Mrs. Dursley and has a son named Dudley, who is described as throwing a tantrum at breakfast. Mr. Dursley is portrayed as being oblivious to the magical happenings around him, focusing instead on his work and a large order of drills he hopes to secure that day (Context: \"Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work...\").",

      "country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for\nwork, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming\nDudley into his high chair.\nNone of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.\nAt half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs.\nDursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed,",
      "2\nbecause Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the\nwalls. \"Little tyke,\" chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got\ninto his car and backed out of number four's drive.\nIt was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of\nsomething peculiar -- a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley\ndidn't realize what he had seen -- then he jerked his head around to\nlook again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet\nDrive, but there wasn't a map in sight. What could he have been thinking\nof? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and\nstared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the\ncorner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now\nreading the sign that said Privet Drive -- no, looking at the sign; cats\ncouldn't read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and\nput the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of\nnothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.\nBut on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something\nelse. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn't help\nnoticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people\nabout. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in\nfunny clothes -- the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this\nwas some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering\nwheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite\nclose by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was\nenraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all; why, that man\nhad to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The\nnerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some\nsilly stunt -- these people were obviously collecting for something...\nyes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr.",

But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some\nsilly stunt -- these people were obviously collecting for something...\nyes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr.\nDursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.\nMr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the\nninth floor. If he hadn't, he might have found it harder to concentrate\non drills that morning. He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad\ndaylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed\nopen- mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never\nseen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly\nnormal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made\nseveral important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a\nvery good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he'd stretch his legs\nand walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.",
      "3\nHe'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of\nthem next to the baker's. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn't\nknow why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering\nexcitedly, too, and he couldn't see a single collecting tin. It was on\nhis way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he\ncaught a few words of what they were saying.\n\"The Potters, that's right, that's what I heard yes, their son, Harry\"\nMr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the\nwhisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better\nof it.\nHe dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his\nsecretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost\nfinished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the\nreceiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking... no, he was\nbeing stupid. Potter wasn't such an unusual name. He was sure there were\nlots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think\nof it, he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry. He'd never even\nseen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point\nin worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her\nsister. He didn't blame her -- if he'd had a sister like that... but all\nthe same, those people in cloaks...\nHe found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and\nwhen he left the building at five o'clock, he was still so worried that\nhe walked straight into someone just outside the door.\n\"Sorry,\" he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It\nwas a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a\nviolet cloak. He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the\nground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in\na squeaky voice that made passersby stare, \"Don't be sorry, my dear sir,\nfor nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at"

      "189\n\"I -- I know I can't keep him forever, but I can't jus' dump him, I\ncan't.\"\nHarry suddenly turned to Ron. Charlie, he said.\n\"You're losing it, too,\" said Ron. \"I'm Ron, remember?\"\n\"No -- Charlie -- your brother, Charlie. In Romania. Studying dragons.\nWe could send Norbert to him. Charlie can take care of him and then put\nhim back in the wild!\"\n\"Brilliant!\" said Ron. \"How about it, Hagrid?\"\nAnd in the end, Hagrid agreed that they could send -an owl to Charlie to\nask him.\nThe following week dragged by. Wednesday night found Hermione and Harry\nsitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to\nbed. The clock on the wall had just\nchimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open. Ron appeared out of\nnowhere as he pulled off Harry's invisibility cloak. He had been down at\nHagrid's hut, helping him feed Norbert, who was now eating dead rats by\nthe crate.\n\"It bit me!\" he said, showing them his hand, which was wrapped in a\nbloody handkerchief. \"I'm not going to be able to hold a quill for a\nweek. I tell you, that dragon's the most horrible animal I've ever met,\nbut the way Hagrid goes on about it, you'd think it was a fluffy little\nbunny rabbit. When it bit me he told me off for frightening it. And when\nI left, he was singing it a lullaby.\"\nThere was a tap on the dark window.\n\"It's Hedwig!\" said Harry, hurrying to let her in. \"She'll have\nCharlie's answer!\"\nThe three of them put their heads together to read the note.\nDear Ron,\nHow are you? Thanks for the letter -- I'd be glad to take the Norwegian\nRidgeback, but it won't be easy getting him here. I think the best thing",
      "188\n\"Bless him, look, he knows his mommy!\" said Hagrid.\n\"Hagrid,\" said Hermione, \"how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow,\nexactly?\"\nHagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from his face\n-- he leapt to his feet and ran to the window.\n\"What's the matter?\"\n\"Someone was lookin' through the gap in the curtains -- it's a kid --\nhe's runnin' back up ter the school.\"\nHarry bolted to the door and looked out. Even at a distance there was no\nmistaking him.\nMalfoy had seen the dragon.\nSomething about the smile lurking on Malfoy's face during the next week\nmade Harry, Ron, and Hermione very nervous. They spent most of their\nfree time in Hagrid's darkened hut, trying to reason with him.\n\"Just let him go,\" Harry urged. \"Set him free.\"\n\"I can't,\" said Hagrid. \"He's too little. He'd die.\"\nThey looked at the dragon. It had grown three times in length in just a\nweek. Smoke kept furling out of its nostrils. Hagrid hadn't been doing\nhis gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy. There\nwere empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floor.\n\"I've decided to call him Norbert,\" said Hagrid, looking at the dragon\nwith misty eyes. \"He really knows me now, watch. Norbert! Norbert!\nWhere's Mommy?\"\n\"He's lost his marbles,\" Ron muttered in Harry's ear.\n\"Hagrid,\" said Harry loudly, \"give it two weeks and Norbert's going to\nbe as long as your house. Malfoy could go to Dumbledore at any moment.\"\nHagrid bit his lip.",
      "212\nthat night you won Norbert? What did the stranger you were playing cards\nwith look like?\"\n\"Dunno,\" said Hagrid casually, \"he wouldn' take his cloak off.\"\nHe saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows.\n\"It's not that unusual, yeh get a lot o' funny folk in the Hog's Head --\nthat's the pub down in the village. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn'\nhe? I never saw his face, he kept his hood up.\"\nHarry sank down next to the bowl of peas. \"What did you talk to him\nabout, Hagrid? Did you mention Hogwarts at all?\"\n\"Mighta come up,\" said Hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember.\n\"Yeah... he asked what I did, an' I told him I was gamekeeper here....\nHe asked a bit about the sorta creatures I took after... so I told\nhim... an' I said what I'd always really wanted was a dragon... an'\nthen... I can' remember too well, 'cause he kept buyin' me drinks....\nLet's see... yeah, then he said he had the dragon egg an' we could play\ncards fer it if I wanted... but he had ter be sure I could handle it, he\ndidn' want it ter go ter any old home.... So I told him, after Fluffy, a\ndragon would be easy...\"\n\"And did he -- did he seem interested in Fluffy?\" Harry asked, try ing\nto keep his voice calm.\n\"Well -- yeah -- how many three-headed dogs d'yeh meet, even around\nHogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy's a piece o' cake if yeh know how to\ncalm him down, jus' play him a bit o' music an' he'll go straight off\nter sleep --\"\nHagrid suddenly looked horrified.\n\"I shouldn'ta told yeh that!\" he blurted out. \"Forget I said it! Hey --\nwhere're yeh goin'?\"\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione didn't speak to each other at all until they\ncame to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy\nafter the grounds.\n\"We've got to go to Dumbledore,\" said Harry. \"Hagrid told that stranger\nhow to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that",
      "182\nFluffy - and he said something about Quirrell's 'hocus pocuss-- I reckon\nthere are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy, loads of\nenchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts\nspell that Snape needs to break through --\"\n\"So you mean the Stone's only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to\nSnape?\" said Hermione in alarm.\n\"It'll be gone by next Tuesday,\" said Ron.\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN\nNORBERT THE NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK\nQuirrell, however, must have been braver than they'd thought. In the\nweeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner, but it\ndidn't look as though he'd cracked yet.\nEvery time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and\nHermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy was\nstill growling inside. Snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper,\nwhich surely meant that the Stone was still safe. Whenever Harry passed\nQuirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile, and Ron\nhad started telling people off for laughing at Quirrell's stutter.\nHermione, however, had more on her mind than the Sorcerer's Stone. She\nhad started drawing up study schedules and colorcoding all her notes.\nHarry and Ron wouldn't have minded, but she kept nagging them to do the\nsame.\n\"Hermione, the exams are ages away.\"\n\"Ten weeks,\" Hermione snapped. \"That's not ages, that's like a second to\nNicolas Flamel.\"\n\"But we're not six hundred years old,\" Ron reminded her. \"Anyway, what\nare you studying for, you already know it A.\"\n\"What am I studying for? Are you crazy? You realize we need to pass\nthese exams to get into the second year? They're very important, I\nshould have started studying a month ago, I don't know what's gotten\ninto me....\""

      "1\nHarry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\nCHAPTER ONE\nTHE BOY WHO LIVED\nMr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say\nthat they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last\npeople you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious,\nbecause they just didn't hold with such nonsense.\nMr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made\ndrills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did\nhave a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had\nnearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she\nspent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the\nneighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their\nopinion there was no finer boy anywhere.\nThe Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and\ntheir greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn't\nthink they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs.\nPotter was Mrs. Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years;\nin fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister, because her\nsister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was\npossible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would\nsay if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the\nPotters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy\nwas another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn't want\nDudley mixing with a child like that.\nWhen Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story\nstarts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that\nstrange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the\ncountry. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for\nwork, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming\nDudley into his high chair.\nNone of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.",
      "81\n\"What are these?\" Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs.\n\"They're not really frogs, are they?\" He was starting to feel that\nnothing would surprise him.\n\"No,\" said Ron. \"But see what the card is. I'm missing Agrippa.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"Oh, of course, you wouldn't know -- Chocolate Frogs have cards, inside\nthem, you know, to collect -- famous witches and wizards. I've got about\nfive hundred, but I haven't got Agrippa or Ptolemy.\"\nHarry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card. It showed a\nman's face. He wore half- moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and\nflowing silver hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture was the\nname Albus Dumbledore.\n\"So this is Dumbledore!\" said Harry.\n\"Don't tell me you'd never heard of Dumbledore!\" said Ron. \"Can I have a\nfrog? I might get Agrippa -- thanks\nHarry turned over his card and read:\nALBUS DUMBLEDORE\nCURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS\nConsidered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is\nparticularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in\n1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and his\nwork on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore\nenjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling.\nHarry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that\nDumbledore's face had disappeared.\n\"He's gone!\"\n\"Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day,\" said Ron. \"He'll be\nback. No, I've got Morgana again and I've got about six of her... do you\nwant it? You can start collecting.\"",
      "questions. There were no photographs of them in the house.\nWhen he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown\nrelation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the\nDursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped)\nthat strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers\nthey were, too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once\nwhile out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry\nfuriously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the\nshop without buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all in\ngreen had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long\npurple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and\nthen walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all these\npeople was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a"
